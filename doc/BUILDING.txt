Building
This project was designed using NetBeans 6.5. NetBeans generates a build.xml for
apache-ant. 'test' is the default target but the project has no test cases, use
'ant jar'. No external libraries are required to build or run this project. If
you do not have ANT javac can build the project.

The shell script 'kick off' files may not fit your environment. Cacti calls these
scripts as 'Data Input Methods' make sure your changes are compatable.

We use hudson to build this project http://www.jointhegrid.com/hudson
