RpcStatisticsForPort
	Hadoop components comminicate with an Rpc mechanism. Each hadoop component
  supports the RpcStatisticsForPort object.

	NumOpenConnections: (GAUGE) (SAMPLED): Good general indicator of cluster
  activitiy. Several connections will always be open. This number will increase
  as the cluster usage increases.

	"NumFilesCreated": (GAUGE) (SAMPLED) :
	"NumFilesListed": (GAUGE) (SAMPLED) :
	"NumGetBlockLocations": (GAUGE) (SAMPLED) :
	"NumFilesRenamed": (GAUGE) (SAMPLED) :
	) : These values will help determine usage patterns in your cluster. NumFilesCreated would indicate the number of files added to the
	cluster per day.

	(
	"SafemodeTime": (GAUGE) (PERSISTANT)
	"FSImageLoadTime": (GAUGE) (PERSISTANT)
	) : These values only change when the cluster enters or leaves start mode or starts up. Graphing them is slightly "overkill" but they
	can become interesting if your cluster takes a long time to start up.
