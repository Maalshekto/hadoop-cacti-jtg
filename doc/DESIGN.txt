Hadoop is under heavy development, JMX objects and attributes are appearing and
vanishing. This monitoring implementation was target to be used by cacti. By
design the classes return non zero status or throw exception. This was done to
avoid complicated abstractions. 

The likely cause of an error is a missing JMX variable. You can use the JWalker
tool to probe your Hadoop systems. Then you can change the constructor of the
effected object.

 public FSDatasetStatus(){
    wantedVariables = new String[] {
    "Remaining",
    "Capacity",
    "DfsUsed" };
    wantedOperations = new String [] {};
  }

Changes to the Java Objects may require changes to Cacti components.
